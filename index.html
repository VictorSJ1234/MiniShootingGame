                <p class="targets_description">
                    No name strikes terror into the hearts of Gotham’s citizens quite like the Joker. In a city overrun with larger-than-life 
                    criminals, the always-laughing villain stands alone. A complete psychopath with no moral compass whatsoever, the Joker, 
                    whose real name and identity remain completely unknown, is characterized by his chalk-white skin, green hair and a 
                    permanent rictus grin stretched across his face. But there isn’t a single thing funny about this particular clown,
                    who only finds humor in the suffering of others.</p>
                
                <p class="targets_description">The Joker first appeared in Gotham City around the same time that the Batman arrived on the 
                    scene, and since their very first confrontation, the Clown Prince of Crime has been the Dark Knight’s most formidable 
                    nemesis. While Batman represents justice and order, the Joker is his complete opposite, seeing himself as an agent of 
                    chaos, the living embodiment of the cruel randomness of fate. The Joker’s psychosis causes his personality to shift between 
                    goofy prankster and mass murderer on a dime, making it impossible to predict his next move. It’s this unpredictability that
                    really makes him such a dangerous opponent.</p>

                    Darkseid (pronounced Dark-side) is a new god of the Fourth World, one of the most powerful beings in the 
                    DC Multiverse. As the tyrannical ruler of Apokolips, he frequently comes into conflict with Superman. </p>
                
                <p class="targets_description">Darkseid's goal was to eliminate all free will from the universe and reshape it
                    into his own image. To this end, he sought to unravel the mysterious Anti-Life Equation, which gives its user 
                    complete control over the thoughts and emotions of all living beings in the universe. Darkseid intended to probe 
                    the minds of every human in order to piece together the Equation. This has caused him to clash with many superheroes 
                    of the DC Universe, notably, the Kryptonian Superman. Darkseid worked behind-the-scenes, using superpowered minions in
                    his schemes to overthrow Earth, including working through Intergang, a crime syndicate which employs Apokoliptian 
                    technology and later morphed into a religious cult that worships Darkseid as the god of Evil. </p>

                    Thanos was a genocidal warlord from Titan, whose objective was to bring stability to the universe by wiping 
                    out half of all life at every level, as he believed its massive population would inevitably use up the universe's 
                    entire supply of resources and perish. To complete this goal, Thanos set about hunting down all the Infinity Stones, 
                    being confident that the combined force of the Stones would grant him sufficient power. Thanos forged alliances with 
                    Loki and Ronan the Accuser in order to track down some of the Stones. However, both alliances cost Thanos much of his 
                    resources, including the Mind Stone and the loyalty of his daughters, Gamora and Nebula. Fed up with all his subordinates'
                    ongoing failures, Thanos made the decision to seek and procur the Stones himself, and he began by forcing Eitri to create
                    the Infinity Gauntlet for him so that he would be able to wield the power of the Stones safely. </p>
